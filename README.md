# Mental Health Text Classification with HuggingFace BERT

This project focuses on classifying mental health-related texts into categories such as **Normal**, **Depression**, **Suicidal**, **Anxiety**, **Stress**, **Bipolar**, and **Personality Disorder**. Using HuggingFace's BERT model, the solution leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques to address critical mental health challenges.

## Introduction

Mental health awareness is essential in today's society. This project aims to automate the classification of mental health-related texts using a fine-tuned BERT model. By accurately categorizing text data, this project can assist in understanding mental health conditions and potentially provide insights for healthcare professionals and researchers.

---

## Features

- Fine-tuned **HuggingFace BERT** for text classification.
- Preprocessing pipeline for text cleaning and tokenization.
- Multi-class classification for mental health categories.
- Visualization of training metrics and results.
- Scalable and modular code for easy adaptability.

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes text samples labeled with one of the following mental health categories:
- Normal
- Depression
- Suicidal
- Anxiety
- Stress
- Bipolar
- Personality Disorder

### Preprocessing
The text data is preprocessed using techniques such as:
- Lowercasing
- Removing special characters and stop words
- Tokenization with BERT tokenizer

---

## Model Architecture

- **Base Model:** BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **Framework:** HuggingFace Transformers
- **Classifier:** Fully connected layer added to the BERT base for multi-class classification.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mental-health-text-classification.git
   cd mental-health-text-classification
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download and set up the dataset in the `data/` directory.

---

## Usage

### Training the Model
Run the notebook for training and evaluation:
```bash
jupyter notebook mental-health-text-classification-with-huggingface.ipynb
```

### Predicting Mental Health Categories
After training, use the model to classify new text data:
```python
from model import MentalHealthClassifier

model = MentalHealthClassifier.load_model("path_to_saved_model")
prediction = model.predict("Sample text about mental health")
print("Predicted category:", prediction)
```

---

## Results

The model achieves the following performance on the test dataset:
- **Accuracy:** XX%
- **Precision:** XX%
- **Recall:** XX%
- **F1-Score:** XX%

Visualizations such as confusion matrices and loss/accuracy graphs are provided in the notebook.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Extend the model to handle more categories.
- Integrate the solution into a web application for real-time text classification.
- Optimize the model for deployment on low-resource devices.

### Next Steps

1. **Dependencies File**: If your notebook uses specific libraries, generate a `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Upload Files**: Ensure the following files are uploaded to your GitHub:
   - `mental-health-text-classification-with-huggingface.ipynb`
   - `requirements.txt`
   - Any datasets or links to the dataset location.
   - A saved version of your model, if applicable.
