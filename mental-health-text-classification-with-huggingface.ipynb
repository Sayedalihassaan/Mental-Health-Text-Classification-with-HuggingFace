Mental health is a crucial area where technology can provide timely insights and support. The goal of this project is to build a robust machine learning model capable of accurately identifying the following mental health categories based on textual input:\r\n\r\n- **Normal**  \r\n- **Depression**  \r\n- **Suicidal**  \r\n- **Anxiety**  \r\n- **Stress**  \r\n- **Bipolar**  \r\n- **Personality Disorder**  \r\n\r\n### Key Features:\r\n1. **State-of-the-Art NLP Model**: Utilizes HuggingFace's BERT, a powerful transformer-based architecture, known for its exceptional performance in text understanding tasks.  \r\n2. **Multiclass Classification**: The model is trained to identify and classify text into one of the seven categories listed above.  \r\n3. **Real-World Applications**: Potential applications include mental health screening, early intervention systems, and support tools for therapists and counselors.  \r\n\r\n### Steps Involved:\r\n1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:  \r\n   - Gather labeled data corresponding to the seven classes.  \r\n   - Clean and preprocess text data to ensure consistency and quality.  \r\n\r\n2. **Model Training and Evaluation**:  \r\n   - Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on the mental health dataset.  \r\n   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.  \r\n\r\n3. **Deployment**:  \r\n   - Implement the trained model in an interactive application or API for real-world use.  \r\n\r\n### Project Objective:\r\nThe primary aim is to demonstrate the power of BERT in understanding nuanced text data and to provide a tool that could assist in identifying and categorizing mental health conditions with high accuracy.  \r\n\r\nThis project not only showcases technical expertise in NLP but also emphasizes its potential to make a meaningful impact on society.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"path = r\"/kaggle/input/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health/Combined Data.csv\"\n\nif os.path.exists(path) :\n    df = pd.read_csv(path)\n    print(\"Successfully loaded file.\")\n\nelse :\n    print(\"Sorry, your file was not found.\")\n    ","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-01T23:32:47.574001Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-01T23:32:47.574875Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-01T23:32:47.960095Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-01T23:32:47.574834Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-01T23:32:47.958931Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Successfully loaded file.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head(10)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-01T23:33:00.456547Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-01T23:33:00.457263Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-01T23:33:00.468353Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-01T23:33:00.457226Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-01T23:33:00.467572Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":6,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"   Unnamed: 0                                          statement   status\n0           0                                         oh my gosh  Anxiety\n1           1  trouble sleeping, confused mind, restless hear...

It ensures that the text is in a format suitable for further analysis and model training. Below is a step-by-step description of the preprocessing steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Convert to Lowercase**:\r\n   - The input text is converted to lowercase to standardize it, making the text case-insensitive.\r\n   \r\n2. **Remove Punctuation**:\r\n   - All punctuation marks (such as commas, periods, etc.) are removed from the text using regular expressions (`re.sub`). This helps to focus only on the words themselves.\r\n\r\n3. **Remove Digits**:\r\n   - Any digits in the text are removed. Since this project is focused on text classification, numerical values may not contribute meaningfully and are therefore excluded.\r\n\r\n4. **Tokenization**:\r\n   - The text is split into individual words (tokens). This step helps break the text into smaller units for processing.\r\n\r\n5. **Remove Stopwords**:\r\n   - Common words that do not contribute much to the meaning (such as \"and,\" \"the,\" \"is,\" etc.) are removed using a predefined list of stopwords. This helps in reducing noise and retaining the most meaningful words.\r\n\r\n6. **Rejoin Words**:\r\n   - After filtering out stopwords, the remaining words are joined back together into a single string of text. This cleansed text is then returned for further use in the model.\r\n\r\n### Additional Data Processing:\r\n- The `cleaned_text` column is created by applying the `preprocessing` function to each row of the `statement` column.\r\n- Two additional columns are added:\r\n  - **`statement_length`**: Contains the length (in characters) of the original text.\r\n  - **`cleaned_text_length`**: Contains the length (in characters) of the preprocessed text, which will likely be shorter than the original.\r\n\r\nThis preprocessing pipeline ensures that the text data is ready for model training, making the model more efficient and effective in processing the mental health text classification task.e length of the text before feeding it into the machine learning model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Preprocessing","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def preprocessing(text) :\n    \n    text = text.lower()\n\n    text = re.sub(r\"[^\\w\\s]\" , \"\" , text)\n\n    text = re.sub(r\"\\d+\" , \"\" , text)\n\n    words = text.split()\n\n    words = [w for w in words if w not in stopwords]\n\n    preprocessing = \" \".join(words)\n\n    return preprocessing\n\n\n\ndf[\"cleaned_text\"] = df[\"statement\"].apply(preprocessing)\n\ndf[\"statement_length\"] = df[\"statement\"].apply(len)\n\ndf[\"cleaned_text_length\"] = df[\"cleaned_text\"].apply(len)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-01T23:37:00.774672Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-01T23:37:00.775561Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-01T23:37:01.034012Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-01T23:37:00.775507Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-01T23:37:01.033139Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head(10)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-01T23:37:02.569723Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-01T23:37:02.570421Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-01T23:37:02.580006Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-01T23:37:02.570387Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-01T23:37:02.579025Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":25,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                                           statement      status  \\\n0               I'm lazy to complain about it ba ihh      Normal   \n1  i think the wifi on my iphone is broken it wil...

Tokenizer ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Tokenization with BERT Tokenizer Description\r\n\r\nIn this code snippet, we are using the **BertTokenizer** from HuggingFace to tokenize the text data for input into the BERT model. Tokenization is a critical step in preparing text data for BERT, as it converts the raw text into a format that the model can understand.\r\n\r\n1. **BERT Tokenizer Initialization**:\r\n   - `tok = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")`:\r\n     - This line initializes the **BERT tokenizer** with the `bert-base-uncased` model. The \"uncased\" version of BERT means that the model does not differentiate between lowercase and uppercase characters. It is useful for text that doesn't rely on case-sensitive meanings.\r\n\r\n2. **Tokenizing the Training Data**:\r\n   - `train_encoding = tok(list(X_train), padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=200)`:\r\n     - `X_train`: The training data (text) is passed as a list of sentences.\r\n     - `padding=True`: This ensures that all sequences are padded to the same length (so that the BERT model can process them in batches).\r\n     - `truncation=True`: This trims the text that exceeds the specified `max_length` (200 tokens in this case). This ensures that the model doesn't process unnecessarily long sequences.\r\n     - `max_length=200`: The maximum length of the tokenized sequence. If any sentence exceeds 200 tokens, it will be truncated to this length.\r\n\r\n3. **Tokenizing the Test Data**:\r\n   - `test_encoding = tok(list(X_test), padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=200)`:\r\n     - The same tokenization process is applied to the test data (`X_test`) to ensure it matches the format required by the BERT model.\r\n\r\n### Purpose of Tokenization:\r\nTokenization splits the input text into subword units (tokens) and converts them into numerical IDs that can be processed by BERT. By padding, truncating, and ensuring all sequences have the same length, this step ensures that the input is consistent and ready for use in model training or evaluation.\r\n\r\nThese tokenized sequences are now ready for input into BERT for further processing and model training.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Tokenization using BERT tokenizer\n\ntok = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\n\ntrain_encoding = tok(list(X_train) , padding=True , truncation=True , max_length=200)\ntest_encodeing = tok(list(X_test) , padding=True , truncation=True , max_length=200)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-01T23:47:11.080579Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-01T23:47:11.080972Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-01T23:47:41.835256Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-01T23:47:11.080939Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-01T23:47:41.834231Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":37},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Converting Encoded Data to Dataset Format\r\n\r\nThis code snippet converts the tokenized training and test data into a dataset format using the **HuggingFace `datasets` library**.

This class is used to create and manage datasets efficiently.\r\n\r\n2. **Creating the Training Dataset**:\r\n   - `df_train = Dataset.from_dict({ ... })`:\r\n     - The `Dataset.from_dict` method creates a `Dataset` object from a dictionary.\r\n     - The dictionary includes:\r\n       - **`input_ids`**: The token IDs generated during tokenization (`train_encoding[\"input_ids\"]`).\r\n       - **`attention_mask`**: A mask indicating which tokens are padding (`train_encoding[\"attention_mask\"]`).\r\n       - **`labels`**: The target labels for the training data, converted to a list using `y_train.tolist()`.\r\n\r\n3. **Creating the Test Dataset**:\r\n   - `df_test = Dataset.from_dict({ ... })`:\r\n     - Similarly, the test data is converted into a `Dataset` object using the same structure:\r\n       - **`input_ids`**: The token IDs for the test data (`test_encoding[\"input_ids\"]`).\r\n       - **`attention_mask`**: The attention masks for the test data (`test_encoding[\"attention_mask\"]`).\r\n       - **`labels`**: The target labels for the test data, converted to a list using `y_test.tolist()`.\r\n\r\n#### Purpose:\r\n- This conversion organizes the data in a structured format compatible with HuggingFace's transformers library.\r\n- It facilitates seamless integration with data loaders, training pipelines, and evaluation processes.\r\n\r\n#### Output:\r\n- `df_train`: A `Dataset` object containing the tokenized input IDs, attention masks, and labels for the training data.\r\n- `df_test`: A `Dataset` object containing the tokenized input IDs, attention masks, and labels for the test data.\r\n\r\nThese `Dataset` objects can now be used directly for training and evaluating the BERT model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Convert to Dataset format\n\nfrom datasets import Dataset\n\ndf_train = Dataset.from_dict({\"input_ids\" : train_encoding[\"input_ids\"] ,\n                              \"attention_mask\" : train_encoding[\"attention_mask\"] , \n                              \"labels\" : y_train.tolist()})\n\n\n\ndf_test = Dataset.from_dict({\"input_ids\" : test_encodeing[\"input_ids\"] , \n                             \"attention_mask\" : test_encodeing[\"attention_mask\"] , \n                             \"labels\" : y_test.tolist()})\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-02T00:07:34.839465Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-02T00:07:34.839834Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-02T00:07:35.651476Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-02T00:07:34.839800Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-02T00:07:35.650515Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":39},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Fine Tuning Bert","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Fine-Tuning BERT for Sequence Classification\r\n\r\nThis code snippet demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained **BERT model** for the sequence classification task.

Detection System","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Text Classification Function: Detecting Mental Health Categories\r\n\r\nThis section of the project implements a function to classify individual text inputs into one of the predefined mental health categories, leveraging the fine-tuned BERT model. Here's a detailed breakdown:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### 1. **Detection Function**:\r\nThe function `detection_text(text)` is designed to:\r\n- **Preprocess the Input Text**:\r\n  - Applies the preprocessing pipeline to clean and standardize the input text. This ensures consistency with the training data.\r\n- **Tokenize the Cleaned Text**:\r\n  - Converts the cleaned text into tokenized input using the same BERT tokenizer (`tok`) applied during training.\r\n  - The tokenization includes:\r\n    - Padding: Ensures consistent input size.\r\n    - Truncation: Trims input longer than 512 tokens.\r\n    - Conversion to Tensor Format: Prepares data for PyTorch-based model inference.\r\n- **Run the Model for Prediction**:\r\n  - The processed input is fed into the fine-tuned BERT model, which returns logits representing raw classification scores.\r\n- **Determine the Predicted Class**:\r\n  - The logits are processed using `torch.argmax` to extract the class with the highest score, corresponding to the predicted category.\r\n- **Map Class Index to Label**:\r\n  - The predicted class index is translated back to its original category label using the inverse of the label encoding mechanism (`encode.inverse_transform`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### 2. **Sample Texts for Classification**:\r\nA series of example sentences are passed through the `detection_text` function to demonstrate its performance. These examples represent various mental health states, such as:\r\n- **Normal**: Indicating no signs of mental health concerns.\r\n- **Depression**: Expressions of persistent sadness or hopelessness.\r\n- **Suicidal**: Statements reflecting extreme despair or thoughts of self-harm.\r\n- **Anxiety**: Concerns about potential negative outcomes or excessive worry.\r\n- **Stress**: Feeling overwhelmed by life's demands.\r\n- **Bipolar**: Alternating between high-energy, euphoric states and depressive episodes.\r\n- **Personality Disorder**: Statements indicating potential signs of complex personality traits affecting thought patterns.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### 3. **Execution Flow**:\r\n- **Iterating Through Examples**:\r\n  - Each sample text is passed through the `detection_text` function.\r\n  - The predicted mental health category is displayed alongside the original sentence.\r\n- **Output Format**:\r\n  - For each input, the function outputs:\r\n    - The original sentence.\r\n    - The predicted mental health category in a clear and readable format.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### 4. **Purpose and Significance**:\r\n- This function serves as the core of the classification system, enabling real-time or batch processing of mental health-related text data.\r\n- By automating the detection of mental health states, this tool can aid professionals in early detection and provide valuable insights for further intervention.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Key Advantages:\r\n- **Real-Time Classification**:\r\n  - Processes and classifies individual text inputs quickly, making it suitable for live systems.\r\n- **Fine-Tuned Model**:\r\n  - Utilizes a BERT model tailored for the specific mental health categories, ensuring high accuracy.\r\n- **Interpretability**:\r\n  - Outputs human-readable labels, enhancing the practical usability of the system. \r\n\r\nThis function is a crucial component of the project, demonstrating how advanced NLP techniques can be applied to address critical mental health challenges.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def detection_text(text) :\n    cleaned_text = preprocessing(text)\n\n    inputs = tok(cleaned_text , return_tensors=\"pt\" , padding=True , truncation=True , max_length=512)\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\n    logists = outputs.logits  # Purpose: Extracts the logits from the model outputs.
